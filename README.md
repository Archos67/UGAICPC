A place to store all of our icpc solutions. 

Each problem has a folder and individuals can put their solutions. Just follow the convention of LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME.* for your source code put it in the proper directory. If no directory yet exists for your problem, make one! Just name it the problem number (ex. the problem 2111 would be '2111').

Happy coding!
