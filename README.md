A place to store our ICPC solutions. 

Each problem has a folder and individuals can add their solutions.

If no directory exists for your problem, make one! Name it Number_Problem_Name (e.g. 6199_Tsunami or 5958_Triangular_Number)

Your Java source code should be named Main.java and put in a folder called Lastname_Firstname.

Otherwise, your source code should be named LastName_Firstname.*

Happy coding!
