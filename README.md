A place to store our ICPC solutions. 

Each problem has a folder and individuals can add their solutions.

If no directory exists for your problem, make one! Name it Number_Problem_Name (e.g. <code>6199_Tsunami</code> or <code>5958_Triangular_Number</code>)

Your Java source code should be named <code>Main.java</code> and placed in a folder called <code>Lastname_Firstname</code>.

Otherwise, your source code should be named <code>LastName_Firstname.*</code> (e.g <code>Ghyzel_Chris.cpp</code> or <code>Nguyen_Chris.c</code>

Happy coding!
