Boyer Moore doesn't really make any sense to me anymore for this problem. The better searching algorithm is Rabin Karp, becuase 
the boyer moore algorithm will skip a word if there's no letters in the word. This makes no sense for tandem repeats since
we will be looking for a pattern within one large set of letters.

Rabin karp is obviously the better searching algorithm.
KMP could work as well. Boyer Moore definitely doesn't make sense for this problem though.
